About me
======
I am PhD Candidate in Computer Science at <a href="https://cs.illinois.edu/" target="_blank">CS @ ILLINOIS (UIUC)</a>. I am also a member of the <a href="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/" target="_blank">i-acoma</a> group led by <a href="http://iacoma.cs.uiuc.edu/josep/torrellas.html" target="_blank">Prof. Josep Torrellas</a>.

My main research interests lie primarily in the areas of Computer Architecture, Distributed Systems, and High-Performance Computing.

My alma mater is <a href="https://www.csd.uoc.gr/CSD/index.jsp?lang=en" target="_blank">CSD, University of Crete (UOC)</a>, from which I received both my B.Sc. (2017) and my M.Sc. (2019) degrees in Computer Science. My origin is from Heraklion, Crete, Greece.
